                    <p>Everything feels brighter here. White walls, hard shadows, colours that look artificial even when they aren&#8217;t.

                    <p>Mam Tor and Winnats Pass are regular haunts, especially on those rare mornings when the valleys fill with cloud and the world finally shuts up. These photographs come from chasing inversions, misreading forecasts and turning up anyway, because sometimes the Peaks decide to reward stubbornness.</p>

                    <p>Not just Dexter. Friends&#8217; dogs, borrowed companions and the occasional animal that definitely didn&#8217;t agree to be photographed. These are small, chaotic moments rather than formal portraits, taken when everyone forgets the camera is there and behaves like themselves.</p>

                    <p>These images live or die by timing. A moonrise that&#8217;s a minute late, a cloud that drifts too far, a subject that refuses to stand still. When it works, it feels less like taking a photograph and more like briefly winning an argument with the sky.</p>

                    <p>This is the slowest photography I do. Forest floors, damp mornings and kneeling in mud for things most people step over without noticing. The reward is in the details. Fragile structures, brief colours and a world that only seems to exist if you&#8217;re prepared to look for it properly.</p>

            <p>I’m Chris, a photographer based in Yorkshire with a soft spot for quiet places, long lenses, and light that only behaves itself for about ten minutes a day.</p>
            <p>My work spans everything from wide-angle landscapes to tight 600mm wildlife frames, but the thread running through it all is patience. I’m drawn to scenes that have to be earned rather than performed. Standing still in the cold waiting for a kingfisher to appear, planning moon shots days in advance, or chasing the last trace of colour as the hills fade into shadow. It’s less about collecting images and more about working for them.</p>
            <p>This site isn’t about commissions or studio polish. It’s a record of early starts, missed opportunities, occasional small victories and the constant attempt to translate how a place feels, not just how it looks. Landscapes may be my default setting, but I’m always looking for new challenges that force me to see differently.</p>
            <p>All images here are captured locally or during short escapes around the UK, using minimal processing and one simple rule. If the moment didn’t feel special, it didn’t make the cut.</p>
            <p>Welcome to Scarisbrick Visuals.</p>
