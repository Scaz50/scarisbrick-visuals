                    <p>Most of these images start long before I ever pick up the camera. Checking weather, watching the light, and returning to the same places until they finally behave. From empty Yorkshire hills to half-awake cities, this collection is about how familiar places feel when you catch them at the right moment, not how many miles you travelled to get there.</p>

                    <p>These photographs are built on planning more than luck. Moon phases, angles, weather windows and a lot of standing around in the dark hoping the clouds take the night off. Most are captured within short drives from home, chasing rare alignments rather than perfect conditions, and accepting that the best moments usually last about thirty seconds.</p>

Birds, insects and the occasional reluctant mammal, all photographed with long lenses and a lot of patience. Nothing staged, nothing chased. Just waiting quietly until something forgets I?m there.</p>

                    <p>This is where it started. Early mornings with a DJI Mavic 2 Pro, learning how light behaves when you?re not standing in it. Aerial photography taught me to think in shapes, shadows and timing rather than just viewpoints. Most of the images here are about structure and scale, finding patterns that only exist for a few minutes before the sun moves on.</p>

                    <p>Most visits start in the dark and end with cold hands and wet boots. The Lakes reward patience more than enthusiasm, especially at dawn when the water finally calms down and the fells stop pretending to be dramatic. These images are less about big views and more about quiet moments before the crowds remember the place exists.</p>

                    <p>These aren?t set-ups or carefully lit sessions. Just fragments of ordinary life, grabbed between the organised shoots and early starts. They matter because they weren?t meant to be photographs in the first place, just moments that refused to disappear quietly.</p>

                    <p>Everything feels brighter here. White walls, hard shadows, colours that look artificial even when they aren?t. These images are less about discovery and more about restraint, stepping back and letting the place do what it?s been perfecting for a few thousand years.</p>

                    <p>Mam Tor and Winnats Pass are regular haunts, especially on those rare mornings when the valleys fill with cloud and the world finally shuts up. These photographs come from chasing inversions, misreading forecasts and turning up anyway, because sometimes the Peaks decide to reward stubbornness.</p>

                    <p>Not just Dexter. Friends? dogs, borrowed companions and the occasional animal that definitely didn?t agree to be photographed. These are small, chaotic moments rather than formal portraits, taken when everyone forgets the camera is there and behaves like themselves.</p>

                    <p>These images live or die by timing. A moonrise that?s a minute late, a cloud that drifts too far, a subject that refuses to stand still. When it works, it feels less like taking a photograph and more like briefly winning an argument with the sky.</p>

                    <p>This is the slowest photography I do. Forest floors, damp mornings and kneeling in mud for things most people step over without noticing. The reward is in the details. Fragile structures, brief colours and a world that only seems to exist if you?re prepared to look for it properly.</p>

            <p>I’m Chris, a photographer based in Yorkshire with a soft spot for quiet places, long lenses, and light that only behaves itself for about ten minutes a day.</p>
            <p>My work spans everything from wide-angle landscapes to tight 600mm wildlife frames, but the thread running through it all is patience. I’m drawn to scenes that have to be earned rather than performed. Standing still in the cold waiting for a kingfisher to appear, planning moon shots days in advance, or chasing the last trace of colour as the hills fade into shadow. It’s less about collecting images and more about working for them.</p>
            <p>This site isn’t about commissions or studio polish. It’s a record of early starts, missed opportunities, occasional small victories and the constant attempt to translate how a place feels, not just how it looks. Landscapes may be my default setting, but I’m always looking for new challenges that force me to see differently.</p>
            <p>All images here are captured locally or during short escapes around the UK, using minimal processing and one simple rule. If the moment didn’t feel special, it didn’t make the cut.</p>
